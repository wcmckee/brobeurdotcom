<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello. My name is William Mckee. I attended The Learning Connexion from July 2010 till November 2012. I finished with a diploma with honors.
My focus was drawing with a little painting on the side. I also developed a strong interest (obsession?) for computer programming also</p>
<p>My language of choice was Python. Traveling on the Tlc bus from Newtown to Taita and return gave me time to code.</p>
<p>Life drawing was a buzz. It was really one of the only types of classes i would attend. Dans monday, rogers monday (when he had a model), and dans friday (every 2nd week) were my favorite mains to attend. I also appreachied techniques that i learnt from gary freemantle and roger key.</p>
<p>For life drawing i often worked landscape on brown paper or visual diary. Working large is easier than small.</p>
<p>Medium of choice was pencil, colored pencil, oil pastel, and acrylic paint.</p>
<p>Block Weeks meant Robert Franklen, Christena Earl, and Roger Key. Sometimes i would jump between classes for a model.</p>
<p>I often attended life drawing classes outside of tlc - dr sketchy wellington, vincents, and local life drawing classes around the country. I was a goal of mine to travel the world and draw models whereever i go.</p>
<p>My time outside  of tlc was spent blogging about life drawing. My aim was 300 words a day but would often reach lengths of 2000 words. My grammar and writing skills inceased.</p>
<p>I was an onsite student till July 2011. Extramural worked well for me as i was able to focus on life drawing classes and then have days off to explore wellington, and travel.</p>
<p>I became more and more tired of drawing the human body and focused more on enviroment works - working from life and drawing streets, waterfronts, and anything that was in front of me.</p>
<p>On days off from life drawing i focused on 3d modeling. Before attending tlc i had been trained with Maya. This time i decided on using Blender. I began taking my enviorment drawings inside of blender and creating worlds. I began creating small  animated shorts and uploading them to YouTube.</p>
<p>As time went on i needed to  learn another program. Unity3d, a very popular 3d game engine that enables you to create builds for cross platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally got animation sorted in Maya. It's easy. I've animated the balloon and the creature. I also took an old model from Prodo Island and added a animation to it.</p>
<p>Created a scene in Unity with mostly new models, but a few recycled. I love the TF shader. It's shiny.</p>

        <div>
<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p>Couple of weeks ago I created Shark Nightmare for Shark Jam. It's uploaded on &lt;a href="<a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brobeur.sharknightmare&amp;amp;hl=en">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brobeur.sharknightmare&amp;amp;hl=en</a>"&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt; if you would like to download and play it.</p>
<p>The game is simple. It lasts for 6 minutes and during that time it switches between 3 different scenes. For the first two scenes - you can rotate the shark head around the screen by touch. In the third scene you are able to move freely, with the camera following you.</p>
<p>Here are screenshots and a summary post comp:</p>
<p>&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-504" alt="shark5" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shark5-1024x638.png" width="1024" height="638"&gt;</p>
<p>Black background. This gave a real since of emptiness. I used the same script that was used in Hell Earth in order to animated the textures. This gave a sense of movement in the scene. Several models that I created with relearning Maya were used as fillers for the environment. It's very minimal and a tighter and smaller environment may help.</p>
<p>&lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shark4.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-503" alt="shark4" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shark4-1024x639.png" width="1024" height="639"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>This was scene two. You can see the girl character walking forward here. This is the same model that was used for Suburb Nightmare. One element I focused on with this project was shaders. I downloaded a TF Shader and appied it to my models. This gave a cartoonist, shiny look.</p>
<p>&lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shark3.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-502" alt="shark3" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shark3-1024x640.png" width="1024" height="640"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shark2.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-501" alt="shark2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shark2-1024x612.png" width="1024" height="612"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>Opening scene. Had text scrolling up and down - black bars on top and bottom of the screen - to emulate a film type look. You are able to click and move the shark head around the scene.</p>
<p>&lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shark.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-500" alt="shark" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shark-1024x641.png" width="1024" height="641"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pari Noon Nightmare is the name of my game I'm creating for Indie Jolt Contest 10.</p>
<p>Spent the morning modeling in Maya - created several basic models - a balloon and a creature/character. I even have the character rigged - it's got a skeleton attached to the model and I can move it around with the joint tools. I've tried setting keys to create a walk cycle - but it doesn't seem to work. Opened Blender but it just errored on me! Really need to get my laptop fixed that has Linux Mint on it. Maya is great, but I think I'd prefer to stick with Blender - quicker and easier.</p>
<p>Here's the models up to now:</p>
<p>&lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/balloon2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-499" alt="balloon2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/balloon2-1024x576.jpg" width="1024" height="576"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/balloon2.jpg"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>Balloon. Since the theme was party I needed to create some party related items. A balloon is a good start. I started with a cube and built out.  I find that much easier that starting with a circle object.</p>
<p>Next up, the creature:</p>
<p>&lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/balloon2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/char3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-505" alt="char3" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/char3.jpg" width="960" height="540"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>This was spouse to be a lamp or street sign, but turned more into a creature. I think I'll have to create that sign with my next model!</p>
<p>Here's another couple of angle of the model:</p>
<p>&lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/char2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-507" alt="char2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/char2.jpg" width="960" height="540"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/char3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-505" alt="char3" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/char3.jpg" width="960" height="540"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p> &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I decided to take a bus to Auckland. it had been several months since I had been. the main reason for traveling there was A meet up for Auckland game developers. I first attended this meet up in Auckland was January 2013. this was a huge inspiration to create games for the next several months.
I've meet some great people over the year here including Erik, Hayden, Blake, and dozens of chats with like minded individuals.</p>
<p>pizza and drinks are served each month after the talk. its the social aspect is most enjoyable.</p>
<p>I try to talk to as many people as I can - especially those I haven't talked to before.</p>
<p>This time I talked to several people who worked (or had worked) at GameLoft.</p>
<p>GameLoft are hiring a bunch of people currently so it was great to chat to them in order to help my cover letter.</p>
<p>In other news -GameJolt contest 10 is happening this week. The theme is party</p>
<p>Are you going to join?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>

<p>On Friday I went into my Mothers work and drew oil pastel drawings of sharks for - Shark Jam.</p>
<p>Shark Jam is a mini-LD. In the past I haven't had success with ludum dare. This one had to be  different.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning i was on my brothers windows desktop computer. At the start of a jam i also do some concept art - usually with pencil on paper - sometimes digital painting.</p>
<p>Blender wasn't working so i decided to download Maya 2014 and give it a go. It's been years since I've used Maya - my skills i have taught myself in Blender are easily transferable.</p>
<p>I shortcut extrude to e but this replaced rotate. Maya has the same controls as Unity3d for these shortcut keys. I survived, i had the most important key bound - extrude (along with move, rotate, and scale).</p>
<p>Using concept art i modeled out a sharks head. This looked nothing like the art or even a shark! Still - it was a model and it was fresh. It will work.</p>
<p>I also modeled out shapes that could be used as fillers. Now that i had 3 or so models under my belt it was time to move onto unity.</p>
<p>I used a game I'm currently working on Suburb Nightmare 2 as a base - replacing assets and content with fresh, shark related content.</p>
<p>Its always great to learn new techniques and skills. I've never looked at them in the past but this time i explored Shaders. I found a tf2 shader on the unity wiki that i used in the project. This gave a bright, shinny glow to the models. I also took the chance to watch videos on the programming language used with writing shaders. It's fun and easy to understand. In my next project ill like to explore writing my own shaders - likely with editing some preexisting. It will need to use the color i hold so dear.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>Several of my scripts have been improved - including the next level script, along with new scripts - flashing lights, color change over time.</p>
<p>For music - i found a jaws theme on keyboard. I also used a tune from Emily - the girl who worked on redditgamejam with me. Her music is epic.</p>
<p>Shark Nightmare has 3 scenes each lasting 2 mins each. Cinematic adventure game.</p>

<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;hello. It has been several months since I've made a post here.
the windows laptop that the majority of brobeur gamedev was done on was wiped and Linux mint was installed instead. Focus has been on ipython notebook and data processing.</p>
<p>over the past month I have been joining in jams - usually other peoples team</p>
<p>ill cover them now.</p>
<p>asylum jam.</p>
<p>I received an email from a team looking for an artist - 2d and some 3d skills is always a bonus.</p>
<p>Perfect. This was the biggest team I had ever worked with on a game - four.</p>
<p>They were using Git for source control but the project was somewhat messy.</p>
<p>The team were not happy with my bright colors and painting landscapes and people - they wanted more abstract shapes in black and white.</p>
<p>I was very disappointed by the quality of the 3d artists models. They were extremely flat - and awful face scale. Never less - I remodeled his models. sadly the team in the end only used a small squiggle I painted.</p>
<p>Having Unity3d is very important when joining a team using Unity for a jam. I can't expect programmings or other artists to have the level design skills or see my vision!</p>
<p>If you would like to play it - &lt;a href="<a class="reference external" href="http://www.asylumjam.com/submissions/18-crushing-nightmare">http://www.asylumjam.com/submissions/18-crushing-nightmare</a>"&gt;Crushing Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Sorry Linux - web only.</p>
<p>The next game jam I joined - redditbaconjam06.</p>
<p>I had partaked in redditbaconjam05 - producing Surreal Warp Nightmare.</p>
<p>I was invited to a team that had two people - a programmer - Rob - and music by Emily.</p>
<p>Rob made a side scroller shooting game. The music was epic.</p>
<p>This time I decided to focus on level design, with recycling old assets. I sent Rob 3d assets and models to use over the stock images. Sadly he didn't use these. Even sending him a package of art added to the scene didn't work.</p>
<p>It was a busy weekend and I didn't invest enough time. I emailed Rob after the jam and asked if I could get the final package and work on it further. As of now I have received nothing back. Such as life.</p>

<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven day first person shooter is over for 2013. Some top notch games were made. See what I did there?!
BroBeur Studios released a cinematic adventure game, that had elements of first person without the shooter.</p>
<p>The game was developed from the previous weekends effort -  7hfps.</p>
<p>One of the major changes was the use of a animated texture script. This was used in both environment and characters.</p>
<p>The possibilities with this script are endless. For future projects spite sheets will be created for characters and backgrounds. During this project the script was applies to just normal textures. Still it gave an interesting movement and depth to the project.</p>
<p>Another element that was improved upon was loading the next scene. The game has a bunch of scripts to load the next scene every 60 seconds. I'd like to improve on this as 10 scripts all doing the same thing is bad.</p>
<p>Intergrating the camera switch that was used on SuburbNightmare could also add interest. Perhaps on user touch? Would work well for scene that had no character controller.</p>
<p>Find the game over at 7dFPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm about halfway though 7DFPS. My game is going great. Much of the focus has been on 3d modeling, animation, and texture painting. Getting fresh 3d models helps make a project feel very fresh. I then can take these models and apply to scenes - a cinematic adventure game emerged. Each scene lasts 60 seconds with various scenes allowing user input - by touch or click. Since this game was for a First Person Shooter game I wanted to use some elements of a FPS - so player is able to move player in first person mode by clicking. model then moves to where player clicked. The game is on a cycle, after the final scene the first scene loads. You could leave the game and you would continue to complete the game - there is no lose, only a lack of interaction and content. You are not punished.</p>
<p>The game can be played on the web at &lt;a href="<a class="reference external" href="http://brobeur.com/hellearth.html">http://brobeur.com/hellearth.html</a>"&gt;Hell Earth.&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>It has also been submitted to the Google Play Store, keep an eye on&lt;a href="<a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=BroBeur+Studios">https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=BroBeur+Studios</a>"&gt; this page &lt;/a&gt;for it going live.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's some screenshots:</p>
