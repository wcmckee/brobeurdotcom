He walked a similar path each day.
Each day he grew more sad.
The other monsters stared at him as he walked the path.
One foot in front of another. He kept his head down. Eyes focused on the path.
When other monsters walked past he ignored them. Sometimes they would look back
at him and wonder what was going through his head. More often though they would
be in their own world and not notice him.
Snow crunched beneath his feet as he climbed the stairs. The fresh air was good
for his head. It made the pain go away.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>gamejam</category><category>jd33</category><category>story</category><guid>http://brobeur.com/blog/posts/monster-sync-warped.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2015 22:29:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Js13kGames</title><link>http://brobeur.com/blog/posts/Js13kGames.html</link><dc:creator>wcmckee</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Js13kGames is starting soon. It is a annual event that has happened since 2012.
The jam runs for a month from 13:00 CEST, 13th August to 13:00 CEST, 13th September 2015. The theme will be announced at the start of the jam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I'll enter this jam. The rules state the game must be written in javascript. Though I had ideas of writting something in Python
that generates a HTML5 game. Perhaps a text based adventure game would be neat. I would also like to intergrate Twitter - something I have been
exploring recently with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just had a search for Python to Javascript. One result I got was pyjs. Maybe I could enter something...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>gamejam</category><category>javascript</category><category>python</category><guid>http://brobeur.com/blog/posts/Js13kGames.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2015 04:27:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
