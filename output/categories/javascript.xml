It is a annual event that has happened since 2012.
The jam runs for a month from 13:00 CEST, 13th August to 13:00 CEST, 13th September 2015. The theme will be announced at the start of the jam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I'll enter this jam. The rules state the game must be written in javascript. Though I had ideas of writting something in Python
that generates a HTML5 game. Perhaps a text based adventure game would be neat. I would also like to intergrate Twitter - something I have been
exploring recently with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just had a search for Python to Javascript. One result I got was pyjs. Maybe I could enter something...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>gamejam</category><category>javascript</category><category>python</category><guid>http://brobeur.com/blog/posts/Js13kGames.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2015 04:27:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
