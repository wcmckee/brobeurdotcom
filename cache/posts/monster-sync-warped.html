<p>There once lived a monster who was along. He walked a similar path each day.
Each day he grew more sad.
The other monsters stared at him as he walked the path.
One foot in front of another. He kept his head down. Eyes focused on the path.
When other monsters walked past he ignored them. Sometimes they would look back
at him and wonder what was going through his head. More often though they would
be in their own world and not notice him.
Snow crunched beneath his feet as he climbed the stairs. The fresh air was good
for his head. It made the pain go away.</p>
